    The Scottish Highlands are a mountainous region encompassing northwest Scotland.
      Loch Ness is at the centre,
       overlooked by the ruins of medieval Urquhart Castle and known for mythical monster “Nessie”.
        Northeast, near the city of Inverness, dolphins swim in the Moray Firth.
         Southwest, in the Western Highlands, trails wind up Ben Nevis,
          the U.K.’s highest peak, and red deer roam Glencoe valley with its waterfalls.
           I have been a fan of the Scottish landscape and people for as long as I can remember
            they have many similarities with the Irish mostly the use of Gaelic thanks to 
             our ancestors the Celts! The highlands is also known for its high peaks and beautiful landscape,
              this poem describes it beautifully by Gerard Manley Hopkins

           A windpuff-bonnet of fáawn-fróth

             Of a pool so pitchblack, féll-frówning,

               Degged with dew, dappled with dew,

      <em class= "d-styles" onmouseover="style.color='blue'" onmouseout="style.color='azure'">Loch Ness</em>
      <p class="text-align">
         Loch Ness is a large and deep freshwater loch in the Scottish Highlands extending for approximately 37 kilometres (23 miles) southwest of Inverness.
          Its surface level is 16 metres above sea level.
           Loch Ness is best known for alleged sightings of the cryptozoological Loch Ness Monster, also known affectionately as "Nessie".
            Even tho there has been no concrete proof of "Nessie", thousands belive it may exist which makes it very interesting and also my favourite place on this list!
             It is connected at the southern end by the River Oich and a section of the Caledonian Canal to Loch Oich.
              At the northern end there is the Bona Narrows which opens out into Loch Dochfour, which feeds the River Ness and a further section of canal to Inverness, ultimately leading to the North Sea via the Moray Firth.
               It is one of a series of interconnected, murky bodies of water in Scotland; its water visibility is exceptionally low due to a high peat content in the surrounding soil.
                At 56 km2 (22 sq mi), Loch Ness is the second-largest Scottish loch by surface area after Loch Lomond, but due to its great depth, it is the largest by volume in the British Isles.
                 Its deepest point is 230 metres  755 feet), making it the second deepest loch in Scotland after Loch Morar.
                  A 2016 survey claimed to have discovered a crevice extending to a depth of 271 m (889 ft), but further research determined this to be a sonar anomaly.
                   It contains more water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined and is the largest body of water in the Great Glen,
                    which runs from Inverness in the north to Fort William in the south.

       <em class= "d-styles" onmouseover="style.color='blue'" onmouseout="style.color='azure'">Isle of Skye</em>
        <p class="text-align">
           The Isle of Skye, is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland.
           The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous hub dominated by the Cuillin, the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country.
            Although it has been suggested that Sgitheanach describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins.
             The island has been occupied since the Mesolithic period, and its history includes a time of Pictish, Celtic and Norse rule and a long period of domination by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald.
              The 18th century Jacobite risings led to the breaking up of the clan system and later clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms, some of which involved forced emigrations to distant lands.
               Resident numbers declined from over 20,000 in the early 19th century to just under 9,000 by the closing decade of the 20th century.
                Skye's population increased by 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001.
                 About a third of the residents were Gaelic speakers in 2001, and although their numbers are in decline, this aspect of island culture remains important.
                 The main industries are tourism, agriculture, fishing and forestry. Skye is part of the Highland Council local government area.
                  The island's largest settlement is Portree, which is also its capital, known for its picturesque harbour. There are links to various nearby islands by ferry and, since 1995, to the mainland by a road bridge.
                   The climate is mild, wet and windy.
                    The abundant wildlife includes the golden eagle, red deer and Atlantic salmon.
                     The local flora are dominated by heather moor, and there are nationally important invertebrate populations on the surrounding sea bed.
                     Skye has provided the locations for various novels and feature films and is celebrated in poetry and song.

      <p class="text-align">
        Ben Nevis is the highest mountain in Scotland and the United Kingdom.
         The summit is 1,345 metres above sea level and is the highest land in any direction for 739 km.
          Ben Nevis stands at the western end of the Grampian Mountains in the Highland region of Lochaber, close to the town of Fort William.
          The mountain is a popular destination, attracting an estimated 100,000 ascents a year, around three-quarters of which use the Pony Track from Glen Nevis.
           The 700-metre (2,300 ft) cliffs of the north face are among the highest in Scotland, providing classic scrambles and rock climbs of all difficulties for climbers and mountaineers.
            They are also the principal locations in Scotland for ice climbing. The summit, which is the collapsed dome of an ancient volcano, features the ruins of an observatory which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904.
             The meteorological data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather. C. T. R. Wilson was inspired to invent the cloud chamber after a period spent working at the observatory.

      <p class="text-align">
        Eilean Donan (Scottish Gaelic: Eilean Donnain) is a small tidal island situated at the confluence of three sea lochs (Loch Duich, Loch Long and Loch Alsh) in the western Highlands of Scotland, about 1 kilometre from the village of Dornie.
         It is connected to the mainland by a footbridge that was installed early in the 20th century, and is dominated by a picturesque castle that frequently appears in photographs, film and television.
          The island’s original castle was built in the thirteenth century; it became a stronghold of the Clan Mackenzie and their allies, the Clan MacRae. However, in response to the Mackenzies' involvement in the Jacobite rebellions early in the 18th century, government ships destroyed the castle in 1719.
           The present-day castle is Lieutenant-Colonel John Macrae-Gilstrap's 20th-century reconstruction of the old castle.
            Eilean Donan is part of the Kintail National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.
             In 2001, the island had a recorded population of just one person, but there were no "usual residents" at the time of the 2011 census. 
              Eilean Donan, which means simply "island of Donnán", is named after Donnán of Eigg, a Celtic saint who was martyred in 617.
               Donnán is said to have established a church on the island, though no trace of this remains.</p>

       <p class="text-align">
         Glen Coe (Scottish Gaelic: Gleann Comhann), is a glen of volcanic origins, in the Highlands of Scotland.
          It lies in the north of the county of Argyll, close to the border with the historic province of Lochaber, within the modern council area of Highland.
           The glen is noted for its scenic beauty.
            A review by Scottish Natural Heritage in 2010 made reference to the "soaring, dramatic splendour of Glen Coe", and "the suddenness of the transition between high mountain pass and the lightly wooded strath" in the lower glen.
             It also described the journey through the glen on the main A82 road as "one of the classic Highland journeys".
              The main settlement is the village of Glencoe located at the foot of the glen.
               Glen Coe is regarded as the home of Scottish mountaineering and is popular with hillwalkers and climbers.
               On the 13 February 1692, in the aftermath of the Jacobite uprising of 1689, an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe took place in the glen.
                Thirty-eight men from Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by government forces who were billeted with them on the grounds that they had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs, William II and Mary II.
                The Glen is named after the River Coe which runs through it.
                 The name of the river may predate the Gaelic language, as its meaning is not known.
                  It is possible that the name stems from an individual personal name, Comhan (genitive Comhain).

        <p class="text-align">
          Cairngorms National Park is a national park in northeast Scotland, established in 2003. 
          It was the second of two national parks established by the Scottish Parliament, after Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, which was set up in 2002.
           The park covers the Cairngorms range of mountains, and surrounding hills.
            Already the largest national park in the United Kingdom, in 2010 it was expanded into Perth and Kinross. Roughly 18,000 people reside within the 4,528 square kilometre national park.
             The largest communities are Aviemore, Ballater, Braemar, Grantown-on-Spey, Kingussie, Newtonmore, and Tomintoul. Tourism makes up about 80% of the economy.
             In 2018, 1.9 million tourism visits were recorded.
             The majority of visitors are domestic, with 25 per cent coming from elsewhere in the UK, and 21 per cent being from other countries.
