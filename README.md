## Welcome 

This is the Readme for my Scottish Highlands website!
 I hope to provide all the necessary information and and answer any questions you may have.
 I decided to take the approach of making the website first on normal broswer format as in a laptop or computer, 
 then styles and added what was needed for tablet and mobile devices.
 It is responsive on all devices, view the website here https://mackey123.github.io/The-Scottish-Highlands2/

## Design 


### Typograpghy

- The Roboto is the main font present within this site and lato for h1 to h6 headers. I have sans serif as the fallback.

### Imagery 

- There is a a few pictures in this site the main is the one of the Scottish highlands as the home page, all images used throughout are of the highlands to highlight its beauty.

### Colour Scheme

- The main colours used are a light blue for sections and a light grey for backgrounds, navbar is azure to contrast with the home page image. Added highlights to headers to add more interaction some change from azure to blue while some azure to yellow. Used a different tone of blue for certain sections to make them stand out. I also used Webaim to help me decide my colours link to the site here. https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

I will also include screenshots below.

## Features

- The site is responsive and can be viewed on all viewports.

- Contains interactive elements and pop ups.

- Headers change colour when hovered over.

- Forms and contact section to allow users to give feedback.

## Future features

- I would also like to include a questionnaire about the highlands.

- Possibly add a game in the future to add even more interactivity.

- I would use a article element instead of a section element as I got a warning in the html validator saying I should add more h2 to h6 elemnts to that section, however I discovered this very late and knew it would not give my code any errors so I left it but will implement next time.

## Technologies used


### languages used
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Markdown

## Testing 
For my testing I used the W3C validator the html in my project and for javascript I used Jshint and finally Jigsaw for my CSS. 


## To test my code I did it in the following way 

- I ran the code through the three different validators for each of my three languages.

i. I would copy sections of code so as not to do a whole page and fix any problems within the section first.

ii. Paste the code into the correct tester.

iii. Once results and errors (if present) are visble, examine and correct the changes needed.
  
iv. Repeated the same process for the three languages.

- I would browse through the site on the three different types of view port to ensure it worked well.

i. I would browse through all of the site on the mobile and tablet viewports.

ii. I check all the links to make sure they worked correctly, I looked at the text content to make sure it came out the way intended.

iii. I would then make sure that all the correct text is visble and not too small, then I would interact with all the interactive elements to make sure they reacted correctly.

iv.  Open google tools and view any errors present.

v. Correct the changes if needed.

- I also viewed the site on different browsers to see how it reacted.

i. I would open up a diffrent browser be it be it mozilla,internet explorer or google.

ii. I would interact and click all the links available to make sure they worked.

iii. Interact with all interactive elements and code to make sure it ran they way its supposed to.


## changes made 
Upon testing the site a few changes had to be made the main one been that their was a scroll bar everytime the site was viewed on a Tablet or Mobile device , to fix this I added a "z-index: 100; " to the body styles of the site and the problem was solved.

## Testing user stories

## Bugs and problems

- After using the Google dev tools to help correct any mistakes in my code I  came across a error of "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)" so i added a "link rel="shortcut icon" href="#" into the head of my html pages.

- I changed the highlight of some of my header elements to yellow instead of blue so it would stand out more against the image background.

- I had to change a a element on line 68 of the index.html page from a a to a button as it was giving me errors in my validator.

- When opening the the console log on my contact and signup html pages I noticed a error stating "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined" this was happening as my JS was looking for the id of "ems" on these pages so I added it to the headers on the page.

- About a third of the way into the project my footer would not stay at the bottom of the page when the page was viewd on a tablet or mobile device. To fix this I added a min-height of 80vh to my header element.

- There was a problem with my Gallery as the images would not remain visible after a short period of time, To fix this I added a "animation fill mode: forwards"

- I had problem with a "about" button at the footer of the page however it would cause all my styles to not be applied so to fix this I simply removed it as it seemed more trouble then it was worth and was not something I wanted to spend loads of time on.

- I also added my js files into two different files as the code would not work when in the same directory.


## Deployment
To deploy my Project to Github do it following these steps

1. Open up your Github and navigate to your repository.

2. Under the Repository section click settings.

3. Locate Git hub pages by scrolling down and underneath it click the drop-down menu to     select a folder for your publishing source.

4. Click save and locate the link under the same section and click into the site.

## Changes made after deployment

- All my file paths had to be changed my background image and all my nav-bar file paths on my signup and contact html pages.

- It had to be changed by taking a / from infront of it to allow a different file path for Github pages to work deploying my site.

- I had to change my navbars on the contact and signup page from a #About to a "index.html#About" This was done on all the navbar options on the signup and contact html pages. From then all of the site worked the way it was supposed to and on all different viewports.
