## Technologies used




### languages used

## Testing 
For my testing I used the W3C validator the html in my projectand for javascript I used Jsint and finally Jigsaw for my CSS. 


## To test my code I did it in the following way 

- I ran the code through the 3 diffrent validators for each of  my three languages.

i. I would copy sections of code so as not to do a whole page and fix any problems within the section first.

ii. Paste the code into the correct tester.

iii. Once results and errors (if present) are visble, examine and correct the changes needed.
  
iv. Repeated the same process for the three languages.

- I would browse through the site on the three diffrent types of view port to ensure it worked well.

i. I would browse through all of the site on the mobile and table.

ii. I check all the links to make sure they worked correctly, I looked at the text content to make sure it came out the way intended.

iii. I would then make sure that all the correct text is visble and not too small, then I would interact with all the interactive elements to make sure they reacted correctly.

iv.  Open google tools and view any errors present.

v. Correct the changes if needed.

- I also viewed the site on diffrent browsers to see how it reacted.

i. I would open up a diffrent browser wheter it be it mozilla,internet explorer or google.

ii. I would interact and click all the links available to make sure they worked.

iii. Interact with all interactive elements and code to make sure it ran they way its supposed to.


## changes made 
Upon testing the site a few changes had to be made the main one been that their was a scroll bar everytime the site was viewed on a Tablet or Mobile device , to fix this I added a "z-index: 100; " to the body styles of the site and the problem was solved.
