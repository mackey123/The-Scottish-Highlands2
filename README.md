## Testing 
For my testing I used the W3C validator the bbbbb for javascript and bbbb for my CSS. 


## To test my code I did it in the following way 

- I ran the code through the 3 diffrent validators for each of  my three languages.

i. I would copy sections of code so as not to do a whole page and fix any problems within the section first.

ii. Paste the code into the correct tester.

iii. Once results and errors (if present) are visble, examine and correct the changes needed.
  
iv. Repeated the same process for the three languages.

- I would browse through the site on the three diffrent types of view     port to ensure it worked well.
